Cerebral is a Kubernetes cluster autoscaler with pluggable metrics backends and scaling engines.

# Overview

Cerebral is a provider agnostic tool for increasing or decreasing the size of pools of nodes in your Kubernetes cluster in response to alerts generated by user-defined policies.
These policies reference pluggable and configurable metrics backends, e.g. Prometheus, for gathering metrics to make autoscaling decisions on.
Automatically increasing the number of nodes is important in order to meet resource demand, while decreasing the number is helpful in controlling cost.

# Why Use Cerebral?

Manually scaling nodes in a Kubernetes cluster is not feasible given the largely dynamic nature of web infrastructure; thus, automation is needed to assist operators in these tasks.
With the increased importance placed on monitoring and observability in modern infrastructure, operators should be able to easily take action on the metrics they are collecting.

## Alternatives

Another tool for autoscaling is the [Kubernetes Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler).
It is a prerequisite that the integrated providers support Autoscaling Groups (ASGs), a feature which many cloud providers do not have.

Additionally, the method by which scaling occurs is na√Øve; often triggering events too late to be rendered useful.
Cerebral takes a more generic, flexible, and powerful approach to autoscaling by integrating with existing metric backends as input, and in turn, triggering pluggable actions in response to scaling events.

Please refer to our [documentation](/docs) for more information on building, configuring, and running Cerebral.

# Project Status

This project is in alpha.
There may be breaking changes made as we continue to expand the project and integrated user feedback.

Currently, the project has support for using Prometheus as a metrics backend.
[Containership](https://containership.io/) is the first provider to be integrated.
A lot more is to come - please see the GitHub issues for a roadmap, and feel free to open your own issue if a feature you'd like to see isn't already in the roadmap!

# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project and for your interest in contributing!
Feel free to open issues for feature requests, bugs, or even just questions - we love feedback and want to hear from you.

Pull requests are also always welcome!
However, if the feature you're considering adding is fairly large in scope, please consider opening an issue for discussion first.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
